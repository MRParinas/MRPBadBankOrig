# MRPBadBankOrig
Bad Bank Project for MIT (MRPBadBank)

Project Title
MRPBadBankOrig - A Simple Banking Application

Description/Motivation
The MRPBadBankOrig project is a simple banking application designed to help users manage basic financial transactions. This project was developed as part of a learning exercise to demonstrate fundamental web development skills, including creating user accounts, managing deposits and withdrawals, and viewing account balances. The application is intended for those learning full-stack development, as it provides a practical example of how to integrate a React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend, using MongoDB as the database.

This project solves the common educational problem of understanding how to build and integrate different components of a full-stack application. By providing a simple, real-world example, it helps new developers grasp the essentials of application architecture, RESTful APIs, and database interaction.
